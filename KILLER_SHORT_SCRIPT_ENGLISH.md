## üì± WHAT YOU'RE MAKING

You're making a **15-SECOND VIDEO** that will make people CLICK your link like crazy.

The video has 3 simple parts:
1. **HOOK** (first 3 seconds) - Makes people STOP scrolling
2. **CONTRAST** (seconds 3-10) - Shows problem and solution
3. **CTA** (last 5 seconds) - Makes people CLICK your link

---

## üéØ PART 1: HOOK (0-3 seconds)

### WHAT TO DO:

1. **Get a clip from The Voice** where a judge is SHOCKED/EMOTIONAL
   - Example: Judge standing up, hand on chest, tears
   - Example: Judge hitting the button hard
   - Example: Judge with mouth open in surprise

2. **Put the clip in CapCut or your editor**

3. **SILENCE - NO SOUND AT ALL** (this is CRITICAL!)
   - Silence gets attention

4. **ZOOM IN on the judge's face** (make it bigger)

5. **Keep it for 3 seconds EXACT**

### RESULT:
People see a shocked judge in silence. They STOP scrolling and want to know what happened.

## üéØ PART 2: CONTRAST (3-10 seconds)

### WHAT TO DO:

1. **Show 2 clips SIDE BY SIDE:**
   - **LEFT SIDE:** A BAD singer (amateur, weak voice, no technique)
   - **RIGHT SIDE:** A GOOD singer (The Voice, perfect voice, professional)

2. **Each side stays for 3 seconds**

3. **Add text:**
   - Left: "‚ùå AMATEUR" (red)
   - Right: "‚úÖ PROFESSIONAL" (green)

4. **Add the song "I Will Always Love You"** (starts here)

5. **ZOOM IN on the professional singer** (make it bigger)

### RESULT:
People see the CLEAR difference between amateur and professional. They want to learn to sing like that.

---

## üéØ PART 3: CTA (10-15 seconds)

### WHAT TO DO:

1. **Show the judge clip** (standing, applauding, emotional)

2. **Add GIANT text:**
   ```
   LINK IN BIO
   LEARN NOW
   ONLY $47
   ```

3. **Add emojis:**
   - üé§ üé§ üé§
   - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

4. **Make it PULSE** (text blinks)

5. **Add success sound** (ding/whoosh)

6. **End video**

### RESULT:
