## üéØ WHICH SCENARIO IS MOST REALISTIC?

**SCENARIO 2 (AGGRESSIVE) is the most realistic.**

Reasons:
- Your channel already has traffic (10K+ views)
- Course is a natural fit for your audience
- Conversion of 5-10% is realistic for this type of product
- You don't need 2 videos per day to hit $2,000

**Recommendation:** Start with Scenario 2. If it works well, scale to Scenario 3.
